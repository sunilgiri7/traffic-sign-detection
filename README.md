<h1> ‚õîÔ∏è Traffic Signs Detection with YOLO v3, OpenCV and Keras </h1>
- Firstly, trained model in Darknet framework detects Traffic Signs among 4 categories by OpenCV dnn library.
- Then, trained model in Keras classifies cut fragmets of Traffic Signs into one of 43 classes.
- Results are experimental, but can be used for further improvements.
